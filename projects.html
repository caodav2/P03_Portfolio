      <p class="project_description">
        The topic we chose was microbeads being a pollutant to the Burrard Inlet.
        We chose this topic as a group because we felt so closely related to it,
        geographically and user-wise. The Burrard Inlet was literally a matter
        of a sky train away and as basic users of products that contain microbeads,
        such as face wash, we wanted to bring awareness and eliminate the use of microbeads
        for the better of the inlet and the marine animals that resides there.
      </p>

          <p>Choosing a topic: As a group we had to determine and choose a topic concerning threats to the environment. For the assigned task, we were to create a graphical information design, a short animation or a webpage regarding the chosen
            topic and spread the word about it, show solutions, and being informative to our audience.
