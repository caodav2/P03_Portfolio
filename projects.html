        The topic we chose was microbeads being a pollutant to the Burrard Inlet.
        We chose this topic as a group because we felt so closely related to it,
        geographically and user-wise. The Burrard Inlet was literally a matter
        of a sky train away and as basic users of products that contain microbeads,
        such as face wash, we wanted to bring awareness and eliminate the use of microbeads
        for the better of the inlet and the marine animals that resides there.

      <p class="project_description">
        This project began by building an animal from scratch using Processing. I opted to choose to
        replicate a cartoon penguin. The main purpose of this particular milestone for this project
        was to explore and discover the use of basic geometric shapes within the processing environment
        which included, polygons, ellipseâ€™s, rectangles, triangles and quads. The basic shapes such as
        ellipse and rectangle were easy to implement and understand. However, the more difficult shapes
        consisted of the triangle and quads.

          <p>This project is iconic and important to me because I felt that it is a huge accomplishment.
            Prior to this assignment, I had little to no experience in coding. The feeling of accomplishment
            was from the steep learning curve to the completed product. Along the way, it was difficult
            and challenging to learn new functions, code, and even to an extent that basics of using
            the program Processing to compile a functioning and aesthetically pleasing assignment.

          <p>The second component of this project focused on creating a static environment
            that would be suitable and reasonable for the animal to reside within. For this component,
            I decided to create an artic-like environment for the penguin. The main purpose of this
            milestone was still dictated by the use and exploration of the geometric shapes.

          </p>

          <p>The final milestone was the most challenging milestone because it required me to incorporate
            interaction from the animal and the environment. In order to do this,
            it required students to discover and learn the aspects of rotation, transformation and scaling.
