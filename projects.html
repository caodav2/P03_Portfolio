          <p class="content">The topic we chose was microbeads being a pollutant to the Burrard Inlet.
            We chose this topic as a group because we felt so closely related to it,
            geographically and user-wise. The Burrard Inlet was literally a matter
            of a sky train away and as basic users of products that contain microbeads,
            such as face wash, we wanted to bring awareness and eliminate the use of microbeads
            for the better of the inlet and the marine animals that resides there. </p>
