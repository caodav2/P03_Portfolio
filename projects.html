  <!-- Clean Treetment Project -->

      <p class="project_description">

        Clean Treetment is a project that my partner Giselle and I worked on for a design course.
        The objective of this project was to develop a company from the ground up. This included tasks such as,
        branding, logo, name, mission and goals of the company. Clean Treetment is a company that
        inspires to provide our customers with healthy homes. We are a organic and eco-friendly, cleaning
        company.

          <p>Logo Variation: The most important aspect of our company was to determine and create a logo that represented
            our goals and values. We began ideating and moved from one brand logo to another, we filtered down to what we desired
            in our logo, simple and "clean".

          <p>Logo: As a group, we opted for the logo furthest to the right. This water droplet shaped like leave, was ideal
            to us, as it outline the importance of what we wanted to be represented as. A inner curvature leave to brush off
            the impression of "nature and natural" and an exterior water droplet that shows we are a cleaning company.

        <div class="project_challenge_text">
          <p> Throughout the project, we faced many difficulties as this was our first ever design course.
            The most conflicting problem we had was deciding on how we, as a company, wanted to be seen.
            We wanted our logo to represent, nature, organic, tranquility and cleaniless. However, we didn't want to
            overcrowd our brand because we wanted to be recognizable immediately and iconic through a simply logo.
            The ideation process of designing a enticing logo truly took a signicant amount of time, as a result, we reduced
            our logo to two major components, a water droplet and a leaf.

      <p class="project_description">
        This project began by building an animal from scratch using Processing. I opted to choose to
        replicate a cartoon penguin. The main purpose of this particular project
        was to explore and discover the use of basic geometric shapes within the processing environment
        which included, polygons, ellipse’s, rectangles, triangles and quads. The basic shapes such as
        ellipse and rectangle were easy to implement and understand. However, the more difficult shapes
        consisted of the triangle and quads.

          <p>This project is iconic and important to me because I felt that it is a huge accomplishment.
            Prior to this assignment, I had little to no experience in coding. The feeling of accomplishment
            was from the steep learning curve to the completed product. Along the way, it was difficult
            and challenging to learn new functions, code, and even to an extent that basics of using
            the program Processing to compile a functioning and aesthetically pleasing assignment.

        <div class="project_text1">
          <p>The importance of this project is highlighted by the use of Processing. Processing became a enormous
            part of my university career. To be successful in my program (Interactive Arts and Technology), I had to
            be proficient with processing because, a lot of future courses required the minimum knowledge with this
            application. Processing and I have a love-hate relation but this project was certainly a
            stepping stone for myself in terms of learning how to use Processing.

          <p>The second component of this project focused on creating a static environment
            that would be suitable and reasonable for the animal to reside within. For this component,
            I decided to create an artic-like environment for the penguin. The main purpose of this
            milestone was still dictated by the use and exploration of the geometric shapes.

          </p>

          <p>The final milestone was the most challenging milestone because it required me to incorporate
            interaction from the animal and the environment. In order to do this,
            it required students to discover and learn the aspects of rotation, transformation and scaling.
